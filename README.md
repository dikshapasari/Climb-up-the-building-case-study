# Climb-up-the-building-case-study
It's a case study using hacker statistics to solve a problem with intermediate Python skills.

Question:
You are with your friend and about to climb the stairs of a tall building. You are going to do it with a "die roll."
- If the die shows 1 or 2, you go one step downwards
- If the die shows 3, 4, or 5, you go one step upwards
- If the die shows 6, then you roll again, and whatever number appears, you have to climb that many steps.

You can never go below 0 steps.
You have a 0.1% chance of slipping; if you do, you must start from step 0.

You roll the die 100 times and bet with your friend that you can climb up to 60 steps. What are the chances of you winning the bet?


Answer: 78.4% chance that he'll win the bet.
